# 509. Fibonacci Number
# https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

# F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
# F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
# Given n, calculate F(n).

class Solution:

    dp = collections.defaultdict(int)
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 1:
            return n

        if self.dp[n]:
            return self.dp[n]

        self.dp[n] = self.fib(n - 1) + self.fib(n - 2)
        return self.dp[n]
