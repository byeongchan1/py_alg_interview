# 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree
# https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

# Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

# As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):

    val: int = 0
